# fbonizziDotIt

This is **was** my personal website, written just in `HTML`, `JS`, `CSS`.

 Why **was**? Because I made a company, now I own [Imagine Software](https://www.imaginesoftware.it).
 
Why so simple?
Because I don't see any reasons to add dinamicity to a so simple portfolio website!

It shows:
- My portfolio 
- My curriculum vitae
- My contact links
